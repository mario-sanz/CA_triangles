# Cellular Automata #
Animated Cellular Automata using [Matplotlib][matplotlib]

[Cellular automata][cellular_automaton] are models of dynamical systems in discrete time, space, and state inspired by the work of [Jon von Neumann][vonneumann] in the 1950s. He conceived of a world of machines (cells) inhabiting a chessboard space, but instead of simply being black or red, the machine's state was identified by its color. These models are used often in [Artificial Life][artificial_life] Simulations as well as parallel computational devices because the illustrate the following fundamentals of natural computing:

* explicit space and time
* [locality for massive parallelism][massive_parallel]
* [self-organization][self_organization]
* [emergent properties][emergence]
* lifelike behavior


# About my code #

This version of Cellular Automata draws different triangles in the screen according to different laws given by the number. Each number has a different drawing behaviour depending on the painted/non-painted cells on their surroundings. I have attached to the code some cool number laws that I have found along with a random number laws generator. Let me know if you find some other cool number laws!

I have developed it with comments so that everyone with a basic knowledge of Python can follow and understand the code.
No previous knowkedge of Cellular Automata is required to understand it.
